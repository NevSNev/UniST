This script is for single modality application. <br>
Please replace the Models.py in ./models/transfromer with Models_video.py or Models_image.py.<br> 
And replace the inference.py in ./scripts with inference_image.py or inference_video.py.<br>
Meanwhile, replace the images_dataset.py in ./datasets, test_options.py in ./options.

**And this can be combined with Muti-granularity in UniST, enjoy!**
